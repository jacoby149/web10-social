add compression to media. [IF IT IS EASY...]
make an upload limit for the inputs
if posts > 16MB, shoot an error message from web10 failing.
say, compress before posting.
implement automatic client side compression eventually.

in web10, auto attach the creator of web10 data via. request headers.

web10 social needs a centralized place to store posts and their view counts.
as the demand fluctuates for content, fans need to be assigned to service content at random by the server.
that way, celebrities can remain on the platform, distribute their costs across their fans.

every message must be!
first, OR
single
contrary to what super snager wanted.
BECAUSE THE TIMESTAMPS dont work as expected for normal and last.
TELL SUPER SNAGER !!!!

future idea! add birthday, phone number, + more!
